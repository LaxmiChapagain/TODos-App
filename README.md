#  TO-DO List

Your project should fulfill following criteria:
1. A text input field that takes 1 todo item (task).
2. A button to submit the entered todo item. (It adds the latest todo item in the todo list)
3. Below these, display the list of all the todo items
4. Add an event: if user clicks on any todo item from the list, it should be marked done by
any change in the item text (the change can be of your choice, example: by turning the
color of text to gray or by striking thought the text)
5. At the bottom, display an information that tells the count of todo items are NOT marked
done in the format:
“X out of Y tasks remaining” where X is the items that are NOT done yet and Y is the
total number of items in the list.
